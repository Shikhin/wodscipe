Deadfish is a very simple programming language that is good for nothing.

Command  Meaning
i / x    Increment
d        Decrement
s / k    Square
o / c    Output

All commands operate on the accumulator, which is in this implementation a 16b
register. If accumulator becomes -1 (0xFFFF) or 256 (0x0100) it is set to 0.
This is due to historical reasons.
