ResPlicate is a self-modifying automation thingie. On each cycle 2 numbers are
dequeued and interpreted in following fashion:
elements-to-dequeue how-many-times-to-enqueue-those

This implementation also supports the I/O expansion.
putchar: 0 ascii-code
getchar: 0 -n
         Where getchar()-n+1 is then enqueued.
