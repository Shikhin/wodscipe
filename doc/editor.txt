Editor is ed-like, but highly cut-down. The program is read into memory at
startup, and behaves as the front-end for the (arguably is mostly the) IDE.

Editor starts with the first line being the current line. The table below
describes all of the commands supported.

NOTE: Unlike ed, 'a' and 'i' input only one line at a time.
NOTE: Gotoline is very hacky so it caps out at 255 and doesn't hadle error
      conditions correctly
