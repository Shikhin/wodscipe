Entry call:
	SP: usable call stack, TOS being return address to IDE
	BX: points to 0x8000, start of "source code" (with size).
	CS:IP: 0:0x7E00

Interpreter should preserve:
	BX and BP register.
	Segment registers.
	Suitable environment for the BIOS.

API, directly callable after including `wodscipe.inc`:
	putchar:
		in: AL: char to output, uses unix newline
	puts:
		in: SI: ASCIZ string to output
	getch:
		out: AL: inputted char, uses unix newline
		     AH: BIOS scan code for inputted char
	getline:
		in: DI: buffer
		    CX: length of buffer
		out: AX: number of chars read
		WARNING: this method will fail if DS is not 0
